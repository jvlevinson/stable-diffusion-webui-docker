# Project Roadmap

This document outlines the steps to update and maintain the project.

## Updating Dependencies

1. Review the current dependencies in the `requirements.txt` and `Dockerfile` files.
2. Check for updates to these dependencies.
3. Update the `requirements.txt` and `Dockerfile` files with the new versions.
4. Test the project to ensure that the updates do not break any functionality.

## Testing

1. Test the existing scripts to ensure they work as expected.
   * For `.devscripts/chmod.sh`, run the script and check if the executable permissions are correctly set for all `.sh` files in the `services` and `.devscripts` directories.
   * For `.devscripts/migratev1tov2.sh`, `.devscripts/migratev3tov4.sh`, and `.devscripts/migratev7tov8.sh`, run each script and verify that the expected files and directories are created or moved as specified in the scripts.
   * For the Docker-related scripts and configurations, such as `docker-compose.yml`, `services/AUTOMATIC1111/Dockerfile`, `services/comfy/Dockerfile`, and `services/download/Dockerfile`, build and run the Docker containers using the provided `docker-compose.yml` file. Ensure that the containers start without errors and the services are accessible.
   * For the entrypoint scripts, such as `services/AUTOMATIC1111/entrypoint.sh` and `services/comfy/entrypoint.sh`, verify that they correctly set up the environment and mount the necessary directories by checking the container logs and the file system inside the containers.
   * For the configuration scripts, such as `services/AUTOMATIC1111/config.py`, run the script and check if the configuration files are correctly created or updated with the expected values.

## Deploying the Project

1. Build the Docker images using the `docker-compose.yml` file.
2. Push the Docker images to a container registry.
3. Deploy the Docker containers to a server or cloud provider.
4. Monitor the deployed containers to ensure they are running correctly.
5. Update the deployment as needed to fix any issues or add new features.
